    "text": "Professional Experience\nData Scientist, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM | 07/2018 – Present\nDeveloped and productionized two machine learning models and four interactive data visualizations to improve safety, security, and employee retention. Provided ad-hoc data analysis to leadership on the performance of the $177.7 million Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) program. Collaborated with data engineers and software developers to increase the access and maintenance of 83 enterprise data sets. Established best practices in research software development by creating internal software packages and documenting CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitLab.\n\nCo-leader of the five-person data visualization sub-team and technical leader of the four-person UI/UX data visualization style guide team.\nDeveloped three internally used R packages to simplify and standardize database connections, establish visualization standards, and package management.\nProposed and awarded funding from the CIO to publish a data visualization style guide for use by the entire lab in public communications and professional journals. Currently being used by 28% of the Lab’s 14,000 workforce.\nDeveloped R Shiny web interfaces for machine learning predictive models to reduce the number of safety and security incidents.\n\nBiometric Analyst, HID Global, Albuquerque, NM | 01/2012 – 06/2018 Managed the human testing lab; coordinated 53 research studies, in various sites in the US to evaluate biometric sensors. Analyzed resulting data to measure biometric sensor performance and prepare it for machine learning algorithms. Oversaw 12.89 terabytes of collected data. Presented research findings using various media (print, video, and webinars) to both technical and non-technical staff, and clients. Researched and identified new methods for spoofing biometric devices.\n\nCut research study cost and product development time by improving subject recruitment; identified new recruitment methods, and improved communication that led to 48% subject retention rate.\nEngineered a data pipeline to process 3,000 videos from wireless security cameras collected daily throughout research sites in the United States for an object detection algorithm.\nDecreased algorithm development time and improved data quality by implementing new filename conventions, and creating a MATLAB accessible MySQL database to index collected data.\nIdentified three unknown security threats to HID Global biometric sensors that lead to improvements in our fake finger detection algorithm.\nCollaborated with hardware engineers and computer scientists, on the research and development of four biometric sensors; including one for guests accessing the most visited vacation resort in the world."
