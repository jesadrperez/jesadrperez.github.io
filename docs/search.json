    "text": "Professional Experience\nData Scientist, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 07/2018 – Present\nDeveloped and productionized two machine learning models and four interactive data visualizations to improve safety, security, and employee retention. Provided ad-hoc data analysis to leadership on the performance of the $177.7 million Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) program. Collaborated with data engineers and software developers to increase the access and maintenance of 83 enterprise data sets. Established best practices in research software development by creating internal software packages and documenting CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitLab.\n\nCo-leader of the five-person data visualization sub-team and technical leader of the four-person UI/UX data visualization style guide team.\nDeveloped three internally used R packages to simplify and standardize database connections, establish visualization standards, and package management.\nProposed and awarded funding from the CIO to publish a data visualization style guide for use by the entire lab in public communications and professional journals. Currently being used by 28% of the Lab’s 14,000 workforce.\nDeveloped R Shiny web interfaces for machine learning predictive models to reduce the number of safety and security incidents."
