    "text": "Currently, I am a Data Scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. My educational background is a BS in Biology with a minor in Applied Math (2009) and MS in Applied Statistics (2011), both earned at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM. After graduating, I spent six-years as a Data Analyst at HID Globalâ€™s Biometric Center of Excellence in Albuquerque, NM. Then in 2019, I joined the Data Sciences organization at Sandia National Laboratories where I help solve enterprise problems. This requires a mix of machine learning, MLOps, data engineering, and research software development. My primary interests are:\n\nR programming and package development\nCreating impactful data visualizations\nUser-centered design in code development.\n\nDuring my leisure time, I enjoy gardening, cooking, and killing houseplants."
