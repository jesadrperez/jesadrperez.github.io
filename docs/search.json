Presented research findings using various media (print, video, and webinars) to both technical and non-technical staff, and clients. Researched and identified new methods for spoofing biometric devices.\n\nCut research study cost and product development time by improving subject recruitment; identified new recruitment methods, and improved communication that led to 48% subject retention rate.\nEngineered a data pipeline to process 3,000 videos from wireless security cameras collected daily throughout research sites in the United States for an object detection algorithm.\nDecreased algorithm development time and improved data quality by implementing new filename conventions, and creating a MATLAB accessible MySQL database to index collected data.\nIdentified three unknown security threats to HID Global biometric sensors that lead to improvements in our fake finger detection algorithm.\nCollaborated with hardware engineers and computer scientists, on the research and development of four biometric sensors; including one for guests accessing the most visited vacation resort in the world.\n\nData Analyst, NMSU Department of Public Health Sciences, Las Cruces, NM, 08/2010–05/2011\nWhile attending classes full-time, I actively assisted with a variety of health based research projects within the Department of Public Health Science. Provided statistical consulting to 8 graduate students and 11 faculty members at all stages of the research life cycle: grant writing, hypothesis development, survey and experiment design, preparing data, using statistical software to analyze data, and interpreting results for presentation or publication.\n\nThis position was created specifically for me, after the department head was impressed by my knowledge of applied statistics, programming ability (in SAS and R), and communication skills.\nAuthored a presentation with the university’s associate dean of research on using a new metric to measure sexual confront in college students.\n\nStudent Statistical Consultant, NMSU Department of Economics, Applied Statistics, and International Business, Las Cruces, NM , 08/2010–05/2011\nProvided statistical support to graduate students and university staff by advising them on statistical analysis methods and software. Analyzed data with SAS and R. Worked on projects regarding: MBA admissions criteria, crime rates in motels, and dating websites.\nIntern Statistician, USDA Food Safety Inspection Service, Washington, DC, 04/2010–08/2010\nEnsured quality of raw data collected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service in meat, poultry, and processed egg product facilities throughout the United States. Cleaned raw data and updated data warehouse. Used statistical methodologies to estimate the prevalence of foodborne pathogens and prepared relevant figures for professional presentations.\n\nAuthored a report for the public on the prevalence of pathogens in raw poultry products.\nConsulted with other interns from non-technical backgrounds on how to properly use statistical techniques on their work-related projects."

My educational background is a BS in Biology with a minor in Applied Math (2009) and MS in Applied Statistics (2011), both earned at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM. After graduating, I spent six-years as a Data Analyst at HID Global’s Biometric Center of Excellence in Albuquerque, NM. Then in 2019, I joined the Data Sciences organization at Sandia National Laboratories where I help solve enterprise problems. This requires a mix of machine learning, MLOps, data engineering, and research software development. My primary interests are:\n\nR programming and package development\nCreating impactful data visualizations\nUser-centered design in code development.\n\nDuring my leisure time, I enjoy gardening, cooking, and killing houseplants."
