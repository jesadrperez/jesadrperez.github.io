I am currently a **Data Scientist** at [*Capture Higher Ed*](https://www.capturehighered.com/), based in Las Cruces, NM. I hold a [B.S. in Biology](https://bio.nmsu.edu/) with a minor in Applied Mathematics (2009) and an [MS in Applied Statistics](https://business.nmsu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-programs/ms-applied-statistics/applied-statistics-master.html) (2011), both from New Mexico State University.

After graduating, I worked for six years as a **Data Analyst** at [*HID Global's Biometric Center of Excellence*](https://www.hidglobal.com/solutions/identity-authentication-verification-technologies/biometric-technologies) in Albuquerque, NM. In 2019, I joined the Data Sciences organization at [*Sandia National Laboratories*](https://www.sandia.gov/) as a **Data Scientist**. In 2022, I brought my experience to *Capture Higher Ed*, where I help develop predictive models for higher education enrollment. This role blends machine learning, MLOps, data engineering, and software development.

My professional interests include:

-   R programming and package development
-   Creating impactful data visualizations
-   User-centered design in code development.

In my free time, I enjoy gardening, cooking, and—despite my best efforts—occasionally killing houseplants.
