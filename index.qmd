Currently, I am a Data Scientist in Albuquerque, NM at Sandia National Laboratories. In 2011, I received a MS in Applied Statistics from New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM. Afterwards, I spent six-years as a Data Analyst at HID Global's Biometric Center of Excellence in Albuquerque, NM. Then in 2019, I joined Sandia National Laboratories in their Data Sciences organization where I solve enterprise problems. This requires a mix of machine learning, MLOPs, data engineering, and research software development. My primary interest are:

-   R programming and package development
-   Creating meaningful data visualizations
-   User-centered design in code development.

During my leisure time, I enjoy: gardening, cooking Mexican food, and killing houseplants.
