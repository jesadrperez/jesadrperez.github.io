## Professional Experience

**Data Scientist,** *Capture Higher Ed,* Louisville, KY, 08/2022--Present\
As a remote member of Capture Higher Ed, a data-driven enrollment management and marketing firm that helps colleges and universities identify and enroll prospective students; I designed, deployed, and maintained internal- and partner-facing machine learning based applications in R and Python on AWS. Advised nine higher education clients on utilizing our tailored models to achieve their annual enrollment goals and determine financial aid awards. Supported the internal R packages and Docker-based development environments through maintenance and feature enhancements.

-   Rapidly prototyped 2 LLM-powered products (chatbots and content generation) within 6-month deadline using OpenAI models, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and RAG, maintaining market competitiveness with products entering general availability in 2025.
-   Modernized historical apply report system by consolidating scattered R scripts into main package infrastructure, eliminating single-person bottleneck to enable all 4 team members to generate client on-boarding reports and reducing generation time from 2 days to 4 hours.
-   Developed R Shiny application that automated model performance analysis for 15-20 higher education clients, expanding evaluation from 3 manual time points to comprehensive analysis of 15 prediction points across 5 individual models, enabling identification of seasonal patterns and data-driven prediction improvements..
-   Assumed ownership of containerized development environment supporting 4-person data science team's production model deployment, implementing ARM architecture support to enable migration to faster machines and maintaining annual security updates for R/Python libraries and federal data sources


**Data Scientist,** *Sandia National Laboratories,* Albuquerque, NM, 07/2018--08/2022\
At Sandia National Laboratories, a federally funded research and development center advancing national security and technology innovation, I developed and productionized two machine learning models and four interactive data visualizations to improve safety, security, and employee retention. I provided ad-hoc data analysis to leadership on the performance of the $177.7 million Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) program. Collaborating with data engineers and software developers, I enhanced access and maintenance for 83 enterprise data sets, improving data usability across teams. Additionally, I established best practices in research software development by creating internal software packages and documenting CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitLab. 

-   Co-leader of the five-person data visualization sub-team and technical leader of the four-person UI/UX data visualization style guide team.
-   Developed three internally used R packages to simplify and standardize database connections, establish visualization standards, and package management.
-   Proposed and awarded funding from the CIO to publish a data visualization style guide for use by the entire lab in public communications and professional journals. Currently being used by 28% of the Lab's 14,000 workforce.
-   Developed R Shiny web interfaces for machine learning predictive models to reduce the number of safety and security incidents.

**Data Analyst,** *HID Global,* Albuquerque, NM, 01/2012--06/2018\
As a member of HID Global, a leading provider of secure identity solutions specializing in products and services that enable trusted access to physical and digital spaces. I managed the human testing lab; coordinated 53 research studies, in various sites in the US to evaluate biometric sensors. Analyzed resulting data to measure biometric sensor performance and prepare it for machine learning algorithms. Oversaw 12.89 terabytes of collected data. Presented research findings using various media (print, video, and webinars) to both technical and non-technical staff, and clients. Researched and identified new methods for spoofing biometric devices.

-   Cut research study cost and product development time by improving subject recruitment; identified new recruitment methods, and improved communication that led to 48% subject retention rate.
-   Engineered a data pipeline to process 3,000 videos from wireless security cameras collected daily throughout research sites in the United States for an object detection algorithm.
-   Decreased algorithm development time and improved data quality by implementing new filename conventions, and creating a MATLAB accessible MySQL database to index collected data.
-   Identified three unknown security threats to HID Global biometric sensors that lead to improvements in our fake finger detection algorithm.
-   Collaborated with hardware engineers and computer scientists, on the research and development of four biometric sensors; including one for guests accessing the most visited vacation resort in the world.

**Data Analyst,** *NMSU Department of Public Health Sciences,* Las Cruces, NM, 08/2010--05/2011\
While attending classes full-time, I actively assisted with a variety of health based research projects within the Department of Public Health Science. Provided statistical consulting to 8 graduate students and 11 faculty members at all stages of the research life cycle: grant writing, hypothesis development, survey and experiment design, preparing data, using statistical software to analyze data, and interpreting results for presentation or publication.

-   This position was created specifically for me, after the department head was impressed by my knowledge of applied statistics, programming ability (in SAS and R), and communication skills.
-   Authored a presentation with the university's associate dean of research on using a new metric to measure sexual confront in college students.

**Student Statistical Consultant,** *NMSU Department of Economics, Applied Statistics, and International Business,* Las Cruces, NM , 08/2010--05/2011\
Provided statistical support to graduate students and university staff by advising them on statistical analysis methods and software. Analyzed data with SAS and R. Worked on projects regarding: MBA admissions criteria, crime rates in motels, and dating websites.

**Intern Statistician,** *USDA Food Safety Inspection Service,* Washington, DC, 04/2010--08/2010\
Ensured quality of raw data collected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service in meat, poultry, and processed egg product facilities throughout the United States. Cleaned raw data and updated data warehouse. Used statistical methodologies to estimate the prevalence of foodborne pathogens and prepared relevant figures for professional presentations.

-   Authored a report for the public on the prevalence of pathogens in raw poultry products.
-   Consulted with other interns from non-technical backgrounds on how to properly use statistical techniques on their work-related projects.
