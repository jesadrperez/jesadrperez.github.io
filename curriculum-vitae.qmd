## Professional Experience

**Data Scientist,** *Capture Higher Ed,* Louisville, KY, 08/2018--Present\
As a remote Data Science team member, I designed, deployed, and maintained partner-facing machine learning-based applications in R and Python on AWS. Advised partners on utilizing their tailored models to achieve higher education enrollment objectives and determine financial aid awards. Improved internal R packages for the Data Science Team through maintenance and enhancement efforts.
-   Updated and modernized our containerized development environment with latest versions of R and Python, along with supporting ARM-based devices.

**Data Scientist,** *Sandia National Laboratories,* Albuquerque, NM, 07/2018--08/2022\
Developed and productionized two machine learning models and four interactive data visualizations to improve safety, security, and employee retention. Provided ad-hoc data analysis to leadership on the performance of the \$177.7 million Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) program. Collaborated with data engineers and software developers to increase the access and maintenance of 83 enterprise data sets. Established best practices in research software development by creating internal software packages and documenting CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitLab.

-   Co-leader of the five-person data visualization sub-team and technical leader of the four-person UI/UX data visualization style guide team.
-   Developed three internally used R packages to simplify and standardize database connections, establish visualization standards, and package management.
-   Proposed and awarded funding from the CIO to publish a data visualization style guide for use by the entire lab in public communications and professional journals. Currently being used by 28% of the Lab's 14,000 workforce.
-   Developed R Shiny web interfaces for machine learning predictive models to reduce the number of safety and security incidents.

**Data Analyst,** *HID Global,* Albuquerque, NM, 01/2012--06/2018\
Managed the human testing lab; coordinated 53 research studies, in various sites in the US to evaluate biometric sensors. Analyzed resulting data to measure biometric sensor performance and prepare it for machine learning algorithms. Oversaw 12.89 terabytes of collected data. Presented research findings using various media (print, video, and webinars) to both technical and non-technical staff, and clients. Researched and identified new methods for spoofing biometric devices.

-   Cut research study cost and product development time by improving subject recruitment; identified new recruitment methods, and improved communication that led to 48% subject retention rate.
-   Engineered a data pipeline to process 3,000 videos from wireless security cameras collected daily throughout research sites in the United States for an object detection algorithm.
-   Decreased algorithm development time and improved data quality by implementing new filename conventions, and creating a MATLAB accessible MySQL database to index collected data.
-   Identified three unknown security threats to HID Global biometric sensors that lead to improvements in our fake finger detection algorithm.
-   Collaborated with hardware engineers and computer scientists, on the research and development of four biometric sensors; including one for guests accessing the most visited vacation resort in the world.

**Data Analyst,** *NMSU Department of Public Health Sciences,* Las Cruces, NM, 08/2010--05/2011\
While attending classes full-time, I actively assisted with a variety of health based research projects within the Department of Public Health Science. Provided statistical consulting to 8 graduate students and 11 faculty members at all stages of the research life cycle: grant writing, hypothesis development, survey and experiment design, preparing data, using statistical software to analyze data, and interpreting results for presentation or publication.

-   This position was created specifically for me, after the department head was impressed by my knowledge of applied statistics, programming ability (in SAS and R), and communication skills.
-   Authored a presentation with the university's associate dean of research on using a new metric to measure sexual confront in college students.

**Student Statistical Consultant,** *NMSU Department of Economics, Applied Statistics, and International Business,* Las Cruces, NM , 08/2010--05/2011\
Provided statistical support to graduate students and university staff by advising them on statistical analysis methods and software. Analyzed data with SAS and R. Worked on projects regarding: MBA admissions criteria, crime rates in motels, and dating websites.

**Intern Statistician,** *USDA Food Safety Inspection Service,* Washington, DC, 04/2010--08/2010\
Ensured quality of raw data collected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service in meat, poultry, and processed egg product facilities throughout the United States. Cleaned raw data and updated data warehouse. Used statistical methodologies to estimate the prevalence of foodborne pathogens and prepared relevant figures for professional presentations.

-   Authored a report for the public on the prevalence of pathogens in raw poultry products.
-   Consulted with other interns from non-technical backgrounds on how to properly use statistical techniques on their work-related projects.
